# HTML Portfolio Project

Welcome to my HTML portfolio project! This project showcases my skills in web development, utilizing HTML to create a structured and engaging portfolio. Below are the details of the project's objectives, features, and structure.

## Project Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to design and develop a personal portfolio web page that:

- Demonstrates proficiency in HTML by incorporating semantic tags.
- Integrates multimedia elements such as videos and audios.
- Utilizes local links, lists, and tables for effective content organization.
- Incorporates HTML forms for user interaction.
- Features a navigation bar with links to different sections: Home, About, Work, Resume, and Contact.
- Includes dedicated sections for About, Work, Resume, and Contact, each serving its specific purpose.
- Contains a footer with relevant information.

## Project Structure

The portfolio is organized into the following sections:

1. **Home**: The landing page that introduces the portfolio and provides navigation to other sections.

2. **About**: A section that provides information about me, including my background, skills, and interests.

3. **Work**: A showcase of my projects and professional work, demonstrating my capabilities and experience.

4. **Resume**: A detailed overview of my educational background, work experience, skills, and certifications.

5. **Contact**: A section featuring a contact form that allows visitors to reach out to me directly.

6. **Footer**: A footer that includes additional information such as social media links, copyright notice, and other relevant details.

## Features Implemented

- **Semantic HTML Tags**: Used appropriate HTML5 semantic tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` to structure the content meaningfully.

- **Multimedia Integration**: Embedded videos and audios to enhance user engagement and provide interactive content.

- **Local Links, Lists, and Tables**: Organized content using local navigation links for easy access, lists for itemized information, and tables for structured data presentation.
